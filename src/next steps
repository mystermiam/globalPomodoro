Find a way to call actions from the scene 

- Dialogue:

- Try to understand what is different with the movement system? Create vue way of pressing keys?
- Seems to be a phaser 3 problem, not necessarily 2



Vision:
- Earn gold through Pomodoro, can buy stuff with it 




First testable version: 

make them just movable!? no need for copying, etc.

If sessiongoal is finished copy next session goal :unfinished
If sessiongoal is not finished move all sessiongoals one further - if it's completed move the other direction



Issues: 


optional:

- counts time even if its paused to show you your delay (necessary?)

-!- post to Google calendar 

- set different timers

- add times next to the sessions

- Move things around

- Create schedules (replace working session with it)

- Alternative timers 

- Skip option @break

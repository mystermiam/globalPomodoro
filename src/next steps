Minigame tutorial:
- let stars reappear

First testable version: 

If sessiongoal is finished copy next session goal :unfinished
If sessiongoal is not finished move all sessiongoals one further - if it's completed move the other direction



Issues: 


optional:

- post to Google calendar

- set different timers

- counts time even if its paused to show you your delay 

- add times next to the sessions

- Move things around

- Create schedules (replace working session with it)

- Alternative timers 

- Try out beep every 5 minutes / 10 minutes? What effect does that have

- Skip option @break

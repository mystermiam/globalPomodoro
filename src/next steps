--- 1. priority: Enjoy the time you spend working --- 

--- 2. priority: Don't experiment more than 10 minutes! --- 

--- Breathe a few times, before entering into the next pomodoro! Commit fully, respect the break! --- 

--- Take maybe 2 pomodoro sessions to work on one of the hard problems (movement, etc.) - and then continue to work on performance problems



Nuit Blanche: 
- Follow function, character that guides you around
	-Create sequences

- Experience bar (basic interface)

- Map transition

- Movement function

- Fishing function

- After the 28. --> !! Create content !! 

- Create an NPC instead of an item (spritesheet instead of image)
	- add text to NPC


- Push it onto server



Next two priorities: 

- Create maploader
- Change between maps

- need to call functions not only from options but also from normal dialogue


RPG!!!

- If space is pressed and there is no collision with a character show a function of the character (e.g. the link of an item)


Map: 


- load several tilesets into one tilemap
- create a border around the tilemap and put it into the center if it doesn't fit the entire screen

Dialogue:

- call functions dynamically: check 
- Continue dialogue through vue function (window detect spacebar), not phaser one







Hard problems:
- Movement!
	- Vue Key monitor :check
	- Try out movement keys with vue? // it's actually something with my keyboard?

- Absolute paths!

- Iframe
	- Cheerio? Npm
	- Try from server

- Dynamic import


- make chat accessible with enter
	- be able to use all keys
	- Fit into Game screen (toggle it)
		- CSS (opacity of background)
		- 



- Supergoal! Gaelle Prototype 
	- create a box filled with items :check
	- when clicking on the item you can add a link on it :check
	- you can place it in the world :check
	- Get preview on hovering or touching the item, can activate with enter or click on it 


- Try to understand what is different with the movement system? Create vue way of pressing keys?
- Seems to be a phaser 3 problem, not necessarily 2



Vision:
- Earn gold through Pomodoro, can buy stuff with it 




First testable version: 

make them just movable!? no need for copying, etc.

If sessiongoal is finished copy next session goal :unfinished
If sessiongoal is not finished move all sessiongoals one further - if it's completed move the other direction



Issues: 


optional:

- counts time even if its paused to show you your delay (necessary?)

-!- post to Google calendar 

- set different timers

- add times next to the sessions

- Move things around

- Create schedules (replace working session with it)

- Alternative timers 

- Skip option @break 

- Have a learning log function that offers you to write down what you learned during your break




Collaborative storytelling platform: 

- Create rooms with chats and a link to the individual story (storytelling rooms)
